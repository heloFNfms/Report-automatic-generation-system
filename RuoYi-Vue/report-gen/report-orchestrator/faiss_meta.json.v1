In particular, the questionnaire should be deeply grounded\nin the existing literature on AI literacy, should be modular (i.e., including\ndifferent facets that can be used independently of each other) to be flexibly\napplicable in professional life depending on the goals and use cases, and\nshould meet psychological requirements and thus includes further psychological\ncompetencies in addition to the typical facets of AIL. We derived 60 items to\nrepresent different facets of AI Literacy according to Ng and colleagues\nconceptualisation of AI literacy and additional 12 items to represent\npsychological competencies such as problem solving, learning, and emotion\nregulation in regard to AI. For this purpose, data were collected online from\n300 German-speaking adults. The items were tested for factorial structure in\nconfirmatory factor analyses. The result is a measurement instrument that\nmeasures AI literacy with the facets Use & apply AI, Understand AI, Detect AI,\nand AI Ethics and the ability to Create AI as a separate construct, and AI\nSelf-efficacy in learning and problem solving and AI Self-management. This\nstudy contributes to the research on AI literacy by providing a measurement\ninstrument relying on profound competency models.

Analyzing\ndata from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts\nby the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies\nwith strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our\nstudy reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with\neffectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We\ndifferentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel\nareas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes\nexisting processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between\nprototyping focused on developing minimum viable products, and controlled\nexperimentation, focused on rigorous testing such as AB testing. We find that\nLSM complements discovery oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for\nmarket opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities,\nthereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first\nrelease of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by\nusing AB testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI\nto streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the\nimprovement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI\nand LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high quality\nproduct in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware\ndevelopment, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous\nconstruct, as different AI capabilities require distinct organizational\nprocesses to achieve optimal outcomes.",
